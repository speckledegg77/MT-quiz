\# Roadmap



This is the short to-do list. Keep it practical. If something moves from “idea” to “we are doing this”, add it here.



\## Next up

\- \[ ] Improve remote phone audio so autoplay works more often (still keep manual Play clip as fallback).

\- \[ ] Speed up “advance after all answered” so it feels instant on display and phones.

\- \[ ] Round selection: validate that selected packs contain enough questions before creating room.

\- \[ ] Add Quickfire round rules (5 seconds, auto reveal).

\- \[ ] Add Karaoke round format (likely free-text or multiple choice based on lyric line).



\## Quality of life

\- \[ ] Show “Question X of Y” on display.

\- \[ ] Show “Answered: A of B teams” on display during open stage.

\- \[ ] Add a simple “host skip” button (skip to reveal) for edge cases.

\- \[ ] Let host allow late joins (optional toggle).



\## Content building

\- \[ ] Expand question bank and tag packs consistently in data/questions.ts.

\- \[ ] Add more audio clips in Supabase Storage and map them via audioPath.

\- \[ ] Add a picture round (image URL in question, display shows image, phones show options).



\## Later

\- \[ ] Host dashboard for stats (games played, most missed questions).

\- \[ ] Export question bank from Excel to JSON (repeatable script).
